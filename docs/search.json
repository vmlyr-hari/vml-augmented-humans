    "text": "ADR-002: Strategy for Handling AI Model and Provider Uncertainty Status: Accepted Context: The field of AI is volatile. The best model or provider today may be superseded tomorrow. Relying on a single provider creates significant vendor lock-in risk. Furthermore, pricing models can change, and providers could potentially shut down. This uncertainty is a major architectural risk. Decision: We will implement an AI Abstraction Layer (Adapter Pattern) for all interactions with external AI/ML models. This layer will define a generic, internal interface for specific tasks (e.g., predict_demand(location, time), analyze_damage(image)). The concrete implementation of this interface will handle the specific API calls and data transformations for the currently selected provider (e.g., Google Gemini, OpenAI, or a self-hosted model). Consequences: Pros: Decouples our core business logic from specific AI implementations. Allows us to switch AI providers or models by only changing the adapter, minimizing code changes and risk. Facilitates A/B testing of different models. Cons: Adds a minor layer of complexity and potential latency to AI calls. Requires disciplined maintenance of the abstraction layer as new AI capabilities emerge."

    "text": "1. Introduction & Business Context\nMobilityCorp is a growing provider of short-term, “last-mile” transport solutions. Our fleet consists of electric scooters, e-bikes, and electric cars/vans. We operate primarily in dense city locations but are expanding our car and van services into suburban areas.\nOur current operating model is as follows:\n\nCustomer Interaction: Customers use an NFC-capable smartphone app to sign up, locate, book, unlock, and lock vehicles.\nBooking Logic:\nCars & Vans: Can be booked up to 7 days in advance for a specific duration.\nBikes & Scooters: Can be booked up to 30 minutes in advance for an open-ended rental, lasting up to 12 hours.\nVehicle Management: All vehicles are equipped with GPS trackers. Cars and vans can be remotely disabled if necessary.\nReturn Process: Vehicles must be returned to designated parking spots. Cars and vans must be plugged into an EV charger. Customers are required to submit a photo of the returned vehicle as proof and can provide feedback on the vehicle’s condition.\nBilling: Customers are charged per minute. Fines are automatically applied for returning a vehicle late or to an incorrect location.\nLogistics & Maintenance: Our staff perform manual battery swaps for bikes and scooters and redistribute vehicles across our network to meet demand."

    "text": "2. Core Business Challenges\nDespite our growth, we face significant operational inefficiencies and customer satisfaction issues that are hindering our potential. Our primary challenges are:\n\nInefficient Vehicle Distribution: Our most frequent customer complaint is that “the right vehicles aren’t in the right places.” We lack a systematic way to anticipate demand, leading to a poor customer experience and lost revenue. We need to move from a reactive to a predictive model for vehicle placement.\nReactive Maintenance & Charging: We struggle with vehicles running out of charge, particularly bikes and scooters that rely on manual battery swaps. Our staff’s efforts are not optimized; we need a way to prioritize which vehicles and charging bays require service most urgently to maximize fleet availability.\nAd-Hoc Customer Usage: The majority of our customers use our services on an ad-hoc basis. We have a strategic goal to increase customer loyalty and transform our service into a reliable option for regular, daily commutes."

    "text": "ADR-001: Choice of Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) Status: Accepted Context: The MobilityCorp system must handle a high volume of asynchronous, real-time events from thousands of vehicles (GPS updates, battery status) and users (bookings, returns). A traditional synchronous, request-response architecture would create tight coupling between services, leading to cascading failures and difficulty scaling individual components. Decision: We will adopt an event-driven architecture using a central message broker (e.g., Apache Kafka, Google Pub/Sub, AWS Kinesis). Services will communicate by producing and consuming events. For example, when a ride ends, the Booking Service publishes a RideEnded event. The Payment Service consumes this to calculate the bill, and the Smart Return Service consumes it to trigger photo analysis. Consequences: Pros: Enhances scalability, resilience, and loose coupling. Services can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. New services can easily be added to consume existing event streams without modifying producer services. Cons: Introduces complexity in managing eventual consistency, monitoring distributed transactions, and handling event schema evolution. Requires robust dead-letter queue and retry mechanisms."

    "text": "ADR-003: Approach to Smart Return Verification\nStatus: Accepted Context: MobilityCorp requires proof of a correctly completed return, including vehicle location, connection to an EV charger, and condition. Manual verification is not scalable. Decision: We will implement a Smart Return Service that uses computer vision to analyze the photo submitted by the user at the end of a rental. The service will perform a multi-step analysis: Image Authenticity: Check image metadata to ensure it’s a recent photo taken at the time of return. Location Verification: Use image recognition to confirm the vehicle is at a designated parking spot (e.g., by recognizing background landmarks or signage). Damage Detection: Compare the return photo against a pre-rental photo (if available) or a baseline “healthy” image of that vehicle model to flag significant new damage. Connection Check: For EVs, analyze the image to detect the presence of a charging cable connected to the vehicle’s port. Consequences: Pros: Automates a critical business process, reducing operational costs and enabling rapid scaling. Provides immediate feedback to the customer. Creates a data trail for dispute resolution. Risks & Mitigations: Accuracy: False positives/negatives (e.g., flagging a shadow as damage) can lead to poor customer experience. Mitigation: The system will generate a confidence score. Low-confidence results or flagged issues will be automatically routed to a human review queue. The models will be continuously retrained on this human-labeled data. Environmental Factors: Poor lighting, bad weather, or low-quality photos can impact accuracy. Mitigation: The mobile app will guide the user on how to take a good photo (e.g., “Please ensure the entire side of the car is visible”). The system will be trained on a diverse dataset including various lighting and weather conditions. Data Privacy: User-submitted photos are personal data and must be handled according to GDPR. Mitigation: All photos will be stored securely with strict access controls. We will implement data retention policies to automatically delete photos after a set period."
