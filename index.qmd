### Predictive Demand & Fleet Rebalancing: An AI model to forecast demand and optimize vehicle placement.

As a Customer, I would like a Bike, in order to commute to work.

?? Overflow partnerships for customer service -- how to model this out ??

### Optimized Battery Management: A system to prioritize battery swaps and route maintenance staff efficiently.

### Smart Return Verification: Using image analysis to confirm proper vehicle returns and charging connections.

Is to create a system which provides multiple-data poitns, checks and balances and different levels of details in order to increase resolution of the information available about the vechile condition at the point of return.   The burden of informaiton is distributed across actors in order to reduce gaming of the system, provide different data points and reduce burden on any one actor.

**Customer Return**

- Onboard help / agentic/real-time/embodied AI to get the vehcile to the right spot.
- Opporutnity for gamification

Nomenclature -- use Equipment instead of Vehcile.
A Vehcile is a type of Rentable Equipment

?? Naming is hard.  Staff distinctions need clarification ??

?? All self-service or staff-serviced ??
