## AI Summmary

_Notes transcribed using WPP Open, Gemini 2.5 Flash_

### Users & Vehicles
*   Customers
*   Business Corp
*   **Vehicle Types:** Scooter, Bike, Car, Van

### Fleet & Booking
*   **Fleet:**
*   Scooters
*   Bikes
*   Cars
*   Vans
*   **Booking:**
*   7-day radius
*   On-time

### Location & Incentives
*   The "right place" -> **LOCATION**
*   Designated parking spot
*   A specific GPS
*   Location-based incentives

### Data Models
*   `Location` table:
*   GPS coords
*   ID
*   `location_supported_vehicle` table:
*   ID
*   `location_probabilities` table

### Models & AI Inputs
*   **MODELS:**
*   Parking "state"
*   Traffic
*   Behavior
*   Seasonal / Time

### Things to Predict
*   Location
*   Proximity to energy infrastructure
*   Energy usage
*   Demand
*   Type of vehicle
*   Fleet servicing demand:
*   Charge
*   Defects
*   "Fix" location

### Data Flow for Prediction
*   Historical Data --> Training Data
*   Training Data --> Realtime Data
*   Realtime Data --> Historical Data

### Challenges
*   Can we add infrastructure at points-of-interest?
*   Can we add support/logistics to improve service?

### System Intelligence & Operations
*   **Intelligence:** Mind, Training, Compute
*   **Operations:** Logistics Operations
*   **Customer:** Usage, Customer
*   Flow: Intelligence -> Operations -> Customer -> Intelligence

### App-Level Data & Behavior
*   **App-level: "Where are you going?"** (e.g., Work, Fun, Groceries)
*   Increase data points
*   Gives depth/dimensions to data
*   Surface new probabilities
*   **Data Categorization:**
*   Who -> Customer
*   Where -> Location
*   What -> Activity
*   **Pre-event:**
*   Matching
*   Interest/demand
*   Incentives
*   **Post-event:**
*   Additional inquiry for data to support tagging & quantitative data.
*   Intent ----> Actual behavior

### Predictability & Incentives
*   User -> Intended User Behavior -> Actual User Behavior
*   **Diagram (Potential for Missed Promises / Moral Hazard):**
*   Timeline with a section marked "Potential for missed promises" and "Potential for moral hazard".
*   What makes predictable?
*   **Trip Scenarios:**
*   A --> B (Standard trip)
*   A <-- ? B (Disincentivizes return to "correct" location, incentivizes "hoarding")
*   What kind of scooter?

### System Requirements & Risks
*   For the system to work, have to have a parking spot -> NOT any spot, a specific/enabled destination with charging station.
*   Logistics + Infrastructure -> Limited capability in some metro areas.
*   Risks & Unknowns <- show this in our work.

### Fleet Extension & Business Models
*   Extend our fleet to last-last-last mile "concierge" valet to carry our groceries...
*   **User Scenarios:**
*   Person with basket on bike (riding)
*   Person walking
*   Person with scooter and box (scooting)
*   **Calculations:**
*   Distance
*   Minimum minutes
*   **Path A to B:**
*   A -- dotted line --> B
*   Subscription model -> increase probability of demand (reduce fluctuating)
*   Customer (n?) <-> Vehicle (n?) -> fixed n of vehicles

## AI Summary - Generated Diagrams

### Data for AI

_Note: This diagram is fine.  Reference the drawing since it is prettier._

```{mermaid}
graph TD
FD[Fleet Data] --> AI(AI)
GD[GIS Data] --> AI
CD[Customer Data] --> AI
```

### Evolving Data

_Note: This diagram adds some unintended relationships.  Reference the drawing for a better intent._

```{mermaid}
graph LR
HD[Historical Data] --> TD[Training Data]
TD --> RD[Realtime Data]
RD --> HD
```

### Data Sources for Modeling

_Note: This may be better represented as a sequence diagram.  Reference the drawing for a better intent._


```{mermaid}
graph TD
subgraph Intelligence
    MTC[Mind, Training, Compute]
end
subgraph Operations
    LO[Logistics Operations]
end
subgraph Customer
    UC[Usage, Customer]
end

MTC --> LO
LO --> UC
UC --> MTC
```

### Huh?

_Note: This diagram doesn't really represent anything in the conversation correctly._

```{mermaid}
graph LR
    subgraph "Timeline"
        A[ ] --- B[ ] --- C[ ] --- D[ ] --- E[ ] --- F[ ]
    end
    %% TODO fix syntax error if this is desired
    %% style F fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    %% note right of F: Potential for missed promises
    %% note right of F: Potential for moral hazard
```

### Route Mapping

_Note: This diagram is meant to show how routes vary and are not straightlines.  In conversation we discussed predicting routes based on availabile data.  Reference the drawing for a better intent._

```{mermaid}
graph LR
A(A) -- dotted line --> B(B)
```
