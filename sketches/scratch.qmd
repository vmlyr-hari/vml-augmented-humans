_Start AI from WPP Open query_

## 1. Introduction & Business Context

MobilityCorp is a growing provider of short-term, "last-mile" transport solutions. Our fleet consists of electric scooters, e-bikes, and electric cars/vans. We operate primarily in dense city locations but are expanding our car and van services into suburban areas.

Our current operating model is as follows:

*   **Customer Interaction:** Customers use an NFC-capable smartphone app to sign up, locate, book, unlock, and lock vehicles.
*   **Booking Logic:**
*   **Cars & Vans:** Can be booked up to 7 days in advance for a specific duration.
*   **Bikes & Scooters:** Can be booked up to 30 minutes in advance for an open-ended rental, lasting up to 12 hours.
*   **Vehicle Management:** All vehicles are equipped with GPS trackers. Cars and vans can be remotely disabled if necessary.
*   **Return Process:** Vehicles must be returned to designated parking spots. Cars and vans must be plugged into an EV charger. Customers are required to submit a photo of the returned vehicle as proof and can provide feedback on the vehicle's condition.
*   **Billing:** Customers are charged per minute. Fines are automatically applied for returning a vehicle late or to an incorrect location.
*   **Logistics & Maintenance:** Our staff perform manual battery swaps for bikes and scooters and redistribute vehicles across our network to meet demand.

## 2. Core Business Challenges

Despite our growth, we face significant operational inefficiencies and customer satisfaction issues that are hindering our potential. Our primary challenges are:

1.  **Inefficient Vehicle Distribution:** Our most frequent customer complaint is that "the right vehicles aren't in the right places." We lack a systematic way to anticipate demand, leading to a poor customer experience and lost revenue. We need to move from a reactive to a predictive model for vehicle placement.

2.  **Reactive Maintenance & Charging:** We struggle with vehicles running out of charge, particularly bikes and scooters that rely on manual battery swaps. Our staff's efforts are not optimized; we need a way to prioritize which vehicles and charging bays require service most urgently to maximize fleet availability.

3.  **Ad-Hoc Customer Usage:** The majority of our customers use our services on an ad-hoc basis. We have a strategic goal to increase customer loyalty and transform our service into a reliable option for regular, daily commutes.

## 3. The Architectural Mandate

Our objective is to design a **new target architecture** for the MobilityCorp platform. The central requirement of this new architecture is the **strategic incorporation of Artificial Intelligence (AI)** to directly address the business challenges outlined above.

The proposed solution must detail how AI will be leveraged to:

### Enhance the solution for MobilityCorp (the company):

*   Optimize vehicle distribution by predicting demand hotspots.
*   Create intelligent routing and task prioritization for maintenance staff (e.g., battery swaps, vehicle redistribution).
*   Provide analytics and insights into fleet performance and health.

### Enhance the solution for our customers:

*   Improve vehicle availability and reliability.
*   Potentially create new features that encourage regular use, such as personalized commute planning or dynamic pricing.

Your team's proposal should present a comprehensive architectural vision that is robust, scalable, and considers the real-world constraints and uncertainties of implementing AI-driven systems.
